GestON is a medium or large scale warehouse management platform, whose main characteristic is its easy use and low implementation cost.

The platform can be divided into 2 parts:
- WebSite that was developed thinking about the administration of the warehouses, allowing the creation of accounts and the management of the same, although the WebSite is directed to the administration, it can be used by the employees of the warehouse with some limited functionalities.

- WebSite for mobile devices, its main function is the management of products in the warehouse, and only from this can you read the QRCodes, which greatly facilitate the use of the platform. Initially, I had idealized the realization of an Android application, due to not wanting to limit the platform to Android devices, I chose to create a website, allowing any mobile device to use the platform.
